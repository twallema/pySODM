### Quick installation 
```
pip install pySODM
```

### Aim & Scope

All the simulation projects I've undertaken over the past six years required me to do most of the following,
1. Integrate a system dynamical model
2. Its states may be represented by n-dimensional numpy arrays, labeled using coordinates
3. Its parameters may have time-dependencies 
4. Its parameters may have to be sampled from distributions
5. It may have to be calibrate to a dataset(s) by defining and optimising a cost function

all these features required me to wrap code around an ODE solver, typically `scipy.solve_ivp`, and I got tired of recycling the same code over and over again, so I packaged it into pySODM.

Does other simulation software exist in Python? Sure, but most of them hold your hand by having you define symbolic transitions, which places a limit on the attainable complexity of a model, making it unfit for academic research. I wanted a piece a software that nicely does all the nasty bookkeeping like keeping track of state sizes, time dependencies on parameters, aligning simulations with datasets etc. and does so in a **generically applicable** way so that I'd never hit a software wall mid-project.

### Getting started

- Detailed [installation instructions](installation.md).

- The [quistart tutorial](quickstart.md) teaches the basics of building and simulating models with n-dimensional labeled states in pySODM. It demonstrates the use of *time-dependent parameter functions* (TDPFs) to vary model parameters over the course of a simulation and *draw functions* to vary model parameters during consecutive simulations.

- The [workflow](worfklow.md) tutorial provides a step-by-step introduction to building a mathematical model and calibrating its parameters to a dataset. An SIR disease model is built and the basic reproduction number during an outbreak is determined by calibrating the model to the outbreak data. 

- The [enzyme kinetics](enzyme_kinetics.md) and [influenza 17-18](influenza_1718.md) case studies apply the [workflow](workflow.md) to more advanced, real-world problems. In the enzyme kinetics case study, a 1D packed-bed reactor model is implemented in pySODM by reducing the PDEs to a set of coupled ODEs by using the method-of-lines. In the Influenza 17-18 case study, a stochastic, age-structured model for influenza is developped and calibrated to the Influenza incidence data reported by the Belgian Federal Institute of Public Health. These case studies mainly serve to demonstrate pySODM's capabilities across scientific disciplines and highlight the arbitrarily complex nature of the models that can be built with pySODM.

        > Validated the use of Python 3.12. Validated pySODM on macOS Sonoma 14.5. 'draw functions' only have 'parameters' as mandatory input, followed by an arbitrary number of additional parameters (PR #75). Tutorial environment can now be found in `tutorial_env.yml` and was renamed `PYSODM-TUTORIALS` (PR #76). Users can choose when the simulation starts when calibrating a model (PR #92). Initial model states can now be a function returning a dictionary of states. This initial condition function can have arguments, which become part of the model's parameters, and can therefore be optimised (PR #99).  Deprecation of legacy 'warmup' parameter (PR #100). Change 'states' --> 'initial_states' as input needed to initialize a model (PR #102).
